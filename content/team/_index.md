We've been around for a long time making Empires. Initially as a sole developer project on the Battlefield 1942 engine it moved across to the Source Engine before becoming a community project. Since then many members have contributed and added their unique marks on the game. Now some of those members are rebuilding the game again in Unreal Engine.

## Call for Help

What we really are missing from our UE4 team right now is an **animator** and a **game designer**. If you have experience with animating with the Unreal Engine then please get in touch with one of the
team in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/UH6Sc6B). Note that we are all volunteers and we work on this project for fun.
