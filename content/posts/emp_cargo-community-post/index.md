We're pleased to announce the release of a new map, made by community member **Oktay**

{{< image-resize CoverSpotlightCargo3.png >}}

This beautiful commander map has 4 different sections which open up based on the player count.
It has zip lines, strong rivers, elevators (also with lava underneath) and tons of shipping containers!

You can check out some previews of the map below:


## Briefing
**Brenodi Empire:**

The Northern Faction is attacking our port which support our military supplies in this ongoing war.
Our intel informed us that they even sneaked in a Northern Faction command vehicle !
Quickly destroy the enemy force before they get too big of a threat !

Defend the Area and Defeat Northern Faction.


**Northern Faction:**

The Brenodi Empire didn't expect us attacking their port which is important for their Military logistics.
While the battle continues we successfully sneaked in a Northern Faction command vehicle which will change the outcome for this battle !

Capture the Area and Defeat Brenodi Empire.
