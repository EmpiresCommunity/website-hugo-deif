# Changelog:

## Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug with scout hide not being removed when using squad hide and certain weapons (engineer kit/RPG/Mortar)
- Fixed a bug with the squad aura icon displaying the wrong icon when changing between squads (Displayed for less than a second but it's now fixed.)
- Fixed a bug preventing squad aura effect from being removed when leaving squads sometimes.


## Script/Game Balance
- Changed scout rifle sway pattern to use a Lissajous Curve.
	- Tweaked sway values again to balance the weapon again
	- There was a small amount of interference depending on FPS values for sway, this is now fixed and should be standardized regardless of the player's FPS
- Changes to building damage:
	- Removed the 25% damage increase against unbuilt buildings
		- This was hard not very discoverable and added a layer of complexity to balancing the game.
	- Reverted a feature that would give you a 50% random chance to repair less if the building you were repairing was recently under-fire
- Improved Vehicle Handling as of last patch
- Reduced the recoil slightly on NF 50cal rifle for crouch/prone stances
