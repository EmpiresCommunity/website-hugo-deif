# Changelog:

## Bug fixes
- Fixed a bug with artillery feedback only showing once if your shell/missile hit the exact same place.
- Potentially fixed a bug causing walls to be forever stuck in the building carcass state; the wall would be invincible and never removed. This bug was incredibly hard to reproduce but it seemed that the bug was directly tied to the recycle function. Upon further investigation it seems possible that the bug was caused by the recycle function being called at the exact frame that wall is destroyed.
- Modified the physics model of the NF jeep around the front wheels to prevent trees getting stuck between the wheel and the front grill, when this happened it was near impossible to free the jeep.
