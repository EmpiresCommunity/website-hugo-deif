Changelog:

## Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug causing infantry weapon spread decrement values to not be consistent. Sometimes the spread would decrease a lot more for no reason, this fix will be followed up by additional spread value changes in the scripts to address any balance changes that fixing this may have caused.
- Enhanced senses no longer shows dead enemies on the mini-map.
