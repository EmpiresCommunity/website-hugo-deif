Changelog:
Features Added a new particle effect for turrets disabled by concussion grenades. Changes to how re-equip functions: Re-equip will now restore the previously active weapon, provided the player still has the same weapon. NOTE: Previously the active weapon would be changed to the weapon in slot 2 regardless of what the player was previously holding.</description></item></channel></rss>
