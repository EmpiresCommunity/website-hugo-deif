Changelog: Features Major overhaul to the visibility system that drives the networked information used by the mini-map (and in-game visibility of entities). For more information see the detailed write-up here. https://www.empiresmod.com/posts/visibility-system-overhaul/ Updated the resource income display on the HUD and mini-map: Resource delta and income values now show up to two decimal places when appropriate (e.g. a refinery output of 1.75 will now display as-is, instead of rounding to 1.8). Decimal places are hidden entirely if the value is a whole number. Slightly increased the width of the top-right HUD panel to accommodate the extra digits. Resource delta now uses a moving average of changes over the last 1 second, instead of displaying changes instantly and clearing them after 1 second. This change was made in response to player feedback that the numbers were updating too frequently and were distracting. Bugfixes Fixed a server crash relating to the command vehicle being unexpectedly removed. Fixed a server crash relating to maps that spawn buildings without an initial team being set. Fixed a bug with capture points awarding victory to the incorrect team. Fixed a problem with ablative armor’s HUD icon. The VTF texture file became corrupt due to an issue in the build pipeline that publishes the game. Fixed a bug where the Biological Machine Gun’s damage-over-time effect was being unintentionally reduced by armor angle modifiers. Script/Game Balance Infantry Weapons SMG3 (NF Heavy Carbine) Damage reduced from 32 to 30 Minimal Damage reduced from 18 to 14 FalloffEnd reduced from 10000 to 5000 Clip Size reduced from 12 to 14 Reduced overall accuracy Vehicle Armors Adjusted the angle modifier range from 0–45° to 0–60°. Damage now decreases more gradually, reaching the full reduction only at impact angles greater than 60°. The modifier is used by all armor types, most notably Deflective armor. Regenerative Increased Regeneration from 3/s to 4/s Absorbant Increased Speed to Damage Reduction from -0.00007 to -0.0001 Capacitive Reduced Damage to Heat from 0.05 to 0.02 Reduced Speed to Damage Modifier from 0.000035 to 0 Ablative Increased Damage to Heat from 0 to 0.01 This is something all armors have, it was forgotten until now Deflective Reduced Angle Modifier Damage Reduction from 1 to 0.8 Vehicle Engines Engine heat from driving input is now only applied if handbrake is off and the vehicle is moving. This has been changed to combat Fission engine cooling being applied while stationary. (Handbrake or driving against walls etc.) Fission Reduced Heat at Max from -4 to -3 Bio Diesel Increased Cooling by 0.25 3 Phase Reduced Heat Output at Max from 4 to 3 Vehicle Weapons Nuclear Warhead Increased Weight from 150 to 180 Increased Heat from 75 to 100 Railgun Added armor penetration. 20% of damage will ignore armor. (Calculated after damage multipliers and armor resistances.) Salvo Homing Missiles Heat from 5 to 4 Other changes Explosions that apply heat or biological damage-over-time now reduce effects based on distance to the explosion (falloff). Reduced the rate at which the repair station repairs the armor and hull of command vehicles. Reduced Repair Station Repair (Hull) from 75 to 5 Reduced Repair Station Repair (Armor) from 0.25 to 0.025"><meta property="og:locale" content="en"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="posts"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2025-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2025-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:tag" content="Source"><meta property="og:image" content="https://www.empiresmod.com/posts/empiresmod-update-2-39-0/featured.png"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.1/css/all.min.css type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bulma-carousel@4.0.24/dist/css/bulma-carousel.min.css><title>Empires Mod 2.39.0 Released! &ndash; Empires</title><link rel=icon type=image/png href=https://www.empiresmod.com//images/favicon.png></head><body><div class=wrapper><nav id=navbar class="navbar offset-top is-fixed-top" role=navigation aria-label="main navigation"><div class=container><div class=navbar-brand><a class=navbar-item href=https://www.empiresmod.com/><img src=https://www.empiresmod.com//images/logo.webp>
