Changelog:
Features Added angle snapping to commander building placement. This shares a key bind with multi-unit selection. (Default key is shift.) Added firing sounds to MG turrets. The vehicle health HUD has been improved: The health of each armor plate and hull are overlaid as a number. This feature can be enabled in the advanced options section."><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:url" content="https://www.empiresmod.com/posts/empiresmod-update-2-36-0/"><meta property="og:image" content="https://www.empiresmod.com/posts/empiresmod-update-2-36-0/featured.png"><meta property="article:section" content="posts"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2024-02-17T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2024-02-17T00:00:00+00:00"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.1/css/all.min.css type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bulma-carousel@4.0.24/dist/css/bulma-carousel.min.css><title>Empires Mod 2.36.0 Released! &ndash; Empires

When the server reaches enough players, player muting would stop working as intended.</li><li>Fixed squad heal not removing Bio damage over time effect properly.</li><li>Fixed unintended behaviour where the biological damage over time effect wouldn&rsquo;t extend it&rsquo;s duration if it was applied to vehicle armor by the same weapon repeatedly.</li><li>Fixed an issue where squad recon would spot squad hidden players for longer than intended.</li><li>Fixed various issues where the game&rsquo;s code would skip over the last player when processing through all players in a full server. Unknown what bugs this may have caused.</li><li>Changed building smoke to always emit fire when the building is destroyed, instead of sometimes showing unbuilt/sabotage smoke.</li><li>Neutral tank turning now rotates around the tank&rsquo;s local axis instead of world space. This was causing strange behaviour when driving up/down slopes.<ul><li>Neutral turn is no longer unconstrained in applying angular velocity. Prior to this version, angular velocity was set directly; instead of being applied as an angular force impacting the angular velocity. This will mean that tanks are no longer able to rotate beyond the capability of the force being applied.</li></ul></li><li>Fixed the emp_infantry_restrict team filters being inverted.</li><li>3x Crashes have been fixed.</li><li>Fixed some minor issues in the vehicle HUD. For example, no longer displaying the armor detection overlay for your own vehicle or dead vehicles.</li><li>Map info script parsing system has been refactored.<ul><li>All parameters present in the map info file have sensible defaults, allowing a map to be played even if there is no map info file or the client fails to download it.</li><li>Line breaks can be placed in the objective and description panels using the <code>\n</code> escape sequence.</li><li>Map info can be reloaded client-side using the mapinfo_flushscript command, though this currently requires the map to be reloaded for the changes to take effect.</li></ul></li><li>Fixed commander vote count not resetting between rounds.<ul><li>There are still some client-side vote count issues to resolve but these will be addressed in a future version as it requires large changes to rewrite the client-side vote count system.</li></ul></li><li>Fixed a bug where spotting a building with regular spotting would override the longer spotting provided by binoculars.</li><li>The emp_info_params entity inputs SetNFResources and SetBEResources now function correctly. Previously, they would double the current resource value and then subtract the desired value.</li><li>The vehicle weapon HUD now displays properly when using a vehicle equipped with weapons that are not researched. Previously, unresearched weapons would not show up in the HUD. This was only an issue for maps that spawned in vehicles.</li></ul><h2 id=other-changes>Other Changes</h2><ul><li>Added prop_sphere to the FGD and updated code to allow a radius to be set.</li><li>Added various team colored developer textures for use when designing maps. (&lsquo;&lsquo;&lsquo;materials/dev&rsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo; directory)</li><li>Added the startResearched research script variable. Researches that have startResearched = 1 will already be researched when the game starts (if this is the correct team).<ul><li>This allows specific maps to use the emp_sv_unresearch_item command to set the starting chassis as restricted (Jeep/APC/Light tank/AFV).</li><li>If there are no chassis available the vehicle menu will not open when players attempt to open it.</li></ul></li><li>Changed all turret/camera/radar models to use metal surface property instead of default.</li><li>Lobby server auto-connect has been disabled by default. Auto-connect to lobby can be re-enabled by adding -lobby to the launch options within Steam.</li></ul><h3 id=changes-to-team-joining-functionality>Changes to team joining functionality</h3><ul><li>The code that decides whether a player can join a team has been reworked<ul><li>The skill based auto-balance system which decided how players are put into teams has been disabled.<ul><li>Removed convars &lsquo;mp_autoteambalance&rsquo;, &lsquo;mp_autoteambalance_smart&rsquo;, and &lsquo;mp_autoteambalance_skilldifference&rsquo; as these were used by this system.</li></ul></li><li>Auto-assign has been reverted to a random selection of the available teams.</li></ul></li><li>Added the emp_sv_forceteam convar, which will force all players to join either BE or NF if enabled.</li><li>Completely rewrote the &lsquo;jointeam&rsquo; console command code.<ul><li>Jointeam respects emp_sv_forceteam, emp_sv_forceautoassign, emp_sv_forcespec, and emp_allowspectators.</li></ul></li><li>Added convar &lsquo;mp_teams_unbalance_limit&rsquo;<ul><li>This controls the maximum numbers advantage a team can have before players are no longer allowed to join.</li><li>The default value is 1, which allows each team to have one extra player.</li><li>Setting this convar to 0 disables the limit.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=scriptgame-balance>Script/Game Balance</h2><h3 id=changes-to-stamina-usage-when-jumping>Changes to stamina usage when jumping</h3><p>Jumping stamina usage has been tweaked so that the stamina requirement to jump is 50% of the actual stamina deduction. Additionally, stamina upgrade now reduces the amount of stamina deducted per jump by 1/4 instead of 1/3.</p><ul><li>This means a jump spends 20 stamina (roughly displayed as 3 bars), but you can still jump so long as you have 10 stamina (roughly displayed as 1.5 bars) left. With stamina upgrade, each jump will spend 15 stamina instead of 13.3.</li><li>This change was made to make navigating the map less frustrating when out of combat. This should be less punishing when you have completely depleted your stamina, but still enforce the usual restrictions to combining sprinting and jumping while in combat. The values were tweaked to ensure that even with stamina upgrade, you cannot bunny hop when you&rsquo;re out of stamina.</li></ul><h3 id=vehicle-chassis>Vehicle Chassis</h3><ul><li>Brenodi Empire
